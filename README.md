## Twitter Timeline (2014)

```
This is an attempt to play with twitter API while implementing OAuth 2.0
and parallel curl.
```

## Reflection

It is interesting to see how we used to do those things before shifting
to Node or async programming. You can see how ugly it was to do parallel
curl requests. Also PHP got lots of recent additions so this code is quite
outdated.
